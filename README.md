# BlurHash

BlurHash is a compact representation of a placeholder for an image. It encodes the overall impression of the image into a short string that can be used as a placeholder while the full image is loading. This repository provides utilities to generate BlurHash strings from images.

## Installation

You can install the BlurHash library via npm:

```bash
npm install blurhash get-pixels sharp
